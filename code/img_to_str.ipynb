SmithSchool of Computer Science‘Camegie Mellon University{dbamman,nasmith}@cs.cmu.eduAbstractSarcasm. requires some shared knowledge betweenspeaker and audience; itis a profoundly contextual phe-nomenon. Most computational approaches to sarcasmdetection, however, treat it as a purely linguistic matter,using information such as lexical cues and their corre-sponding sentiment as predictive features. We show thatby including extra-linguistic information from the con-text of an utterance on Twitter — such as properties of theauthor, the audience and the immediate communicativeenvironment ~ we are able to achieve gains in accuracycompared to purely linguistic features in the detectionof this complex phenomenon, while also shedding lighton features of interpersonal interaction that enable sar-asm in conversation,Introduction‘Most approaches to sarcasm detection to date have treatedthe task primarily as a text categorization problem, relyingon the insights of Kreuz and Caucci (2007) that sarcasticutterances often contain lexical indicators (such as interjec-tions and intensifiers) and other linguistic markers (such asnonveridicality and hyperbole) that signal their irony. Thesepurely text-based approaches can be surprisingly accurateacross different domains (Carvalho et al. 2009; Davidov,Tsur, and Rappoport 2010; Gonzélez-Ibéfiez, Muresan, andWacholder 2011; Riloff et al. 2013; Lukin and Walker 2013;Reyes, Rosso, and Veale 2013), but are divorced from anynotion of their potentially useful context. Yet context seemsto matter. For example, humans require access to the sur-rounding context in which a Reddit post was written (suchas the thread it appears in) in order to judge its tone (Wallaceet al, 2014). On Twitter, modeling the relationship betweentweet and an author's past tweets can improve accuracy onthis task (Rajadesingan, Zafarani, and Liu 2015).This kind of contextual information is only one small partof the shared common ground that must be present between,a speaker and their audience in order for sarcasm to be avail-able for use between them. Kreuz (1996) calls this the “prin-ciple of inferability” - speakers only use sarcasm if they canbe sure it will be understood by the audience ~ and finds insurveys that sarcasm is more likely to be used between twoCopyright © 2015, Association for the Advancement of ArtificialIntelligence (www-aaai.org). All rights reserved.574people who know each other well than between those whodo not.Jn all of these cases, the relationship between authorand audience is central for understanding the sarcasm phe-nomenon. While the notion of an “audience” is relativelywell defined for face-to-face conversations between twopeople, it becomes more complex when multiple peopleare present (Bell 1984), and especially so on social media,when a user's “audience” is often unknown, underspecifiedor “collapsed” (boyd 2008; Marwick and boyd 2011), mak-ing it difficult to fully establish the shared ground requiredfor sarcasm to be detected, and understood, by its intended(or imagined) audience.‘We present here a series of experiments to discem the ef-fect of extra-linguistic information on the detection of sar-casm, reasoning about features derived not only from thelocal context of the message itself (as in past work), butalso using information about the author, their relationshipto their audience and the immediate communicative contextthey both share. Our main findings are:+ Including any aspect of the environment (features de-rived from the communicative context, the author, or theaudience) leads to improvements in prediction accuracy.+ Users are more likely to tag their message with the ex-plicit hashtag #sarcasm when they are less familiarwith their audience. Following Kreuz (1996), we arguethat this is a means of ensuring inferability in the face ofuncertainty,Inthe course of this work, we also present a rigorous analy-sis of new and previous features used in sarcasm detection sothat future work in this area can choose to focus its efforts.DataPrior work on sarcasm detection on Twitter (Gonzélez-Tbéfiez, Muresan, and Wacholder 2011) found low agree-‘ment rates between human annotators at the task of judgingthe sarcasm of others’ tweets; consequently, recent researchexploits users’ self-declarations of sarcasm in the form of#sarcasmor #sarcast ic tags of their own tweets. Thisdesign choice does not capture the likely more common va-rieties of sarcasm expressed without an explicit hashtag, butdoes yield positive examples with high precision. Figure 1gives one such example.\n",

You poor lot. You must be so run downand stressed out! | suppose this letter is a letter of thanks for giving me the balls to do what so manyof your customers haven’t been able to do. There are so many things | want to thank you for.Thank you for firstly allowing me to make over 60 phone calls to your company over the last 18months. You delightful people must realise just how much I want to speak to you all on a daily basiswhich is why when you promise to get back to me, you never do! You really know your customers.Thank you for reducing me to tears from pure frustration about 10 times, from never getting tospeak to the person | ask for and having to repeat my 18 month complaint, over and over again. |loved doing that on Christmas Eve. It really got me feeling all festive! You're my own personal brain-training organisation and are really helping to keep my memory fresh and my mental health on topform!Thank you for assigning me TWO complaint handlers! Yes | said TWO!! You really spoil me. And tonot let me speak to them EVER is just hilarious. | mean you really are a comical lot.Thank you for sending me 36 letters in four weeks. | too don’t give a shit about the amount of paperwe use. Screw the environment. Even though I’m on that online billing tariff you mentioned you'dput me on, I still love coming home to find them on my door mat. My favourite was that one whereyou forgot to put that lock on my account that you promised me you would do, and some strangewoman threatened to gain entry to my house when | wasn’t around to try and stop her! | meanseriously my sides are splitting.Thanks for closing down my complaint twice as well. | know you were only trying to help and that’swhy you never told me you'd done it. You only ever want to help | know that.Thanks to Thomas, Daniel, Erin and Scott for all promising me that they would take ownership of mycomplaint. But don’t you all worry, | know that all your other customers are more important than meand I'll continue waiting to hear back from you when you've got time. My time doesn’t mean a thing,I get that.Oh and how could | forget that time when you said you'd discount my bills for my inconvenience?You know, that time you gave me £6? Well | took that £6 and | bought a nice bottle of wine, whichreally helped me after speaking to you.Do you remember that time you made me wait 9 months to get my pre-payment meters removedand then tried to charge me for the time | was actually paying on a card at my local shop? That wasfun wasn't it?And all those tweets | sent to you?? | was just trying to give back a little of what you gave me andyou and you turned me down like a bedspread in a cheap hotel.lastly | want to thank you for the lovely letter you've apparently sent me today, telling me that youcan’t deal with my complaint anymore, and that you've exhausted all options. I’m really sorry that,as a customer, I’ve put you in this position. | really have no right.anyway I really hope you've trained your staff in how to respond to anger and sarcasm, because letsface it, they can’t do anything else right.“*drops mic*\n",

To give an example, theworks of al-Jahiz, a prolific writer from Basra who died in 868/9, are full of allusions to the Saqaliba. Inhis Book of Animals he describes, for instance, how to improve a Slavic slave:“If there are two Slavic brothers from the same mother and father, even if one of them isthe twin brother of the other, when one of them is castrated, he becomes a better servantand smarter in all kinds of activity and manual work. He will be more skilled in them andmore fitting for them. You will also find him more intelligent in conversation ~ these are allhis qualities. His brother will remain in his innate ignorance, natural stupidity and Slavicsimple-mindedness; he will also be unable to understand foreign languages. His hand willbe clumsy and he will not become skilful, because his intellect will not be trained. He willnot be able to express himself freely and eloquently, nor to pronounce clearly. (...) Thefirst result of the castration of a Saqlabi is the purification of his intelligence, sharpening ofhis acumen, strengthening of his nature and stimulation of his mind.\"€\n",

The 6-foot-1 Hogan signed a\"heavily guaranteed\" offer sheet that the Bills willstruggle to match, given that the three-year, $12million deal is front-weighted and has a $5.5 millioncap charge in 2016. The Bills have only $4.5 millionin cap space and probably can't justify shelling outthat much for Hogan, who was their third wideoutlast season.It's tempting to assume Bill Belichick and TomBrady will find a way to turn Hogan into a star, butthat's unlikely to be the case. For more than adecade, guys like Hogan -- LaFell, Donte’ Stallworth,even Donald Hayes -- have come into New Englandand been ancillary targets. There's nothing wrongwith that, and the Patriots need a player who can atleast threaten to stretch the field and outmuscledefensive backs one-on-one the way Hogan can, butthere's probably not a complete receiver lurking inHogan's skill set.\n",

And they wonnational championships. in 1995, 2000,2002, 2003, 2004, 2009, 2010, 2013, 2014 and2015 — that’s 10 times in the last 21 years,and nine times in the last 15. Now, that’smajor news. Only itisn't... because thisisthe UConn women’s team.Even if this year's Huskies win the tour-hament, the N.C.A.A. will pretty much ig-nore them, too. Certainly it will neglectthem financially. Over at the men’s tourna-ment, the N.C.A.A. pays for success: Eachgame a team plays (not including thechampionship) earns the team’s confer-ence roughly $260,000 this year plus$260,000 each of the five following years.So the total value of a vietory in the men’stournament is approximately $1.56 milion, By contrast, a win in the women'stournament brings a reward of exactlyzero dollars. That's right, zero dollars.That sends a strong signal that the‘women’s tournament is less significantand less worthy than the men’s, and it's apolicy that perpetuates a historical pat-tern of discrimination against women ininstitutions of higher education. TheN.C.A.A. needs to start rewarding womenfor their victories.The federal law Title IX requires equalopportunity for each gender in activities(including athletics) sponsored by institu-tions of higher education that receive fed-eral funding. But the N.C.A.A.,a nonprofitthat makes its money from selling televi-sion rights, tickets and corporate sponsor-ships, does not get federal funding and is.not considered by the courts to be a stateactor. It does not have to follow the rules offables sacar bes ibe iawarsAndrew Zimbalist, a professor of econom-jes at Smith College, is the author of “Cir-cus Maximus: The Economic Gamble Be-hind Hosting the World Cup and theOlympics.”Title 1X.‘And it doesn't. The N.C.A.A. used to se-riously encourage the compliance ofmember schools with Title IX and otherregulations through a certificationprocess every 10 years — a collaborativeeffort that involved faculty, students andadministrators. But in 2011, an NCAA.board put a moratorium on that certifica-tion process, Though the N.C.A.A. has de-vised a superficial substitute, there arenow no adequate gender-equity compli-ance reviews in college sports.The N.CA.A. also doesn't protest whenits member schools engage in the count-ing chicanery — unfortunately permissi-ble under federal guidelines — that overSending signals thatmens sporting eventsare more important.states their numbers of female athletes.Male basketball players who practice with‘a women's team can be counted as femaleathletes. Women who run track can becounted as members of three teams: in-door track, outdoor track and eross-coun:try, Female rowing teams sometimes list‘many as 100 members, a preposter-ously high number that is obviously ar-ranged asa Title IX “offset” to the averagesquid size of 20 men on Division I footballteams.The Office for Civil Rights at the De-partment of Education is charged with en-forcing Title IX, butitdoesn’thave enoughresources to fully address all the com-plaints that come in about specific pro-‘grams, et alone undertake its own comp!ance reviews of university athletic depart-ments, Without either the N.C.A.A. or theOffice for Civil Rights applying adequate,pressure, gender equity has lagged in in-tercollegiate athletics, Last year 57 per-cent of all college students were female,yet only slightly more than 40 percent ofcollege athletes were women. Over thepast decade the number of male athletesin college has increased by 53,317, whilethe number of female athletes increasedby only 44,474The N.CA.A’s policy of providing no fi-nancial reward for vietories in thewomen’s basketball tournament is em-blematic of another problem: Athletic ad-ministrators and overseers treat collegesports like a commercial venture. If menbring inthe money, the thinking goes, thenmen should get the money. (Well, some‘men — the coaches, conference commis-sioners and athletic directors, but cer-tainly not the players themselves.)This reasoning is faulty on two levels.First, the men’s tournament may havehigher ratings and sell more expensivetickets, but the women’s tournament isalso a moneymaker: It is broadcast bySSPN and sells out many games. Even byconventional commercial standards, themen shouldn't get $i.36 milion per victory‘while the women get nothing.Second, college sports are not supposedtobe treated as purely commercial activi-ties, The N.C.A.A. constitution considerscollege sport an amateur activity with re-‘deeming physical, social and educationalvalue. There is no clause in Title IX thatsays “except if one gender generatesmore revenue than the other”College sports benefits from preferen-tial fiscal treatment in a variety of formsno taxes on revenues generated by men'sbasketball and football, deductibility forindividual donations that are required toDuy good seats, exemption on interestpayments for bonds to pay for stadiumsand arenas, no requirement for playerpayroll taxes or unemployment insuranceand so on, College sports programs alsoreceive millions of dollars of subsidiesfrom state governments annually,If intercollegiate athletics, under theauspices of the N.C.A.A., wants to contin-ue to receive such preferential treatment,it has to adhere to the educational goals,that it purports to represent. This means‘equal treatment of men and women in allaspects of the educational experience —including granting financial rewards fortheir March Madness. victories. Go‘UConn!obe5a\n",

The first is the col-Japse in the price of solar energy,The cost of generating a kilowatt-hour of electricity from solar ina rea-sonably sunny country is expected tobe the same as that from a coal-firedpower station within a year or two.Indeed, In India - where | currentlylive - some producers are now sellingsolar-generated electricity for theknockdown price of just 4.34 rupeesor 7 cents a kilowatt-hour.But the other reason is internationalfinance and here’s where it gets inter-esting; the economics of renewableenergy are very different from thoseo he Sources of power,Co;anythi jThe sun, wind piece for their fuel,much free, T comes, prettyLj Sy ap aJOUuTCce Viclimatechangeinvestment decision.Just think for a moment about whatit means.With traditional fossil fuel powerplants, the investment case will bemade as a balance between the costsof building the power station, thefuture price of electricity and a pro-jection of the future costs of the fuelneeded to keep it producing power.With renewables it is almost allabout the initial capital cost howmuch it costs to build the thing in thefirst place and the electricity price.That means the cost of solar in thelong run is a combination of the costof the panels, the price of electricityand crucially the long-term cost ofborrowing the money you need to buyand install them. That created a bigproblem with getting the investmentneeded for renewable technologies indeveloping countries, because thesetend to have much higher interestrates than more advanced econo-mies.At the moment, for example, long-term interest rates in most of the de-veloped world are bumping along justabove zero per cent a year, meaningsolongas you can persuade someoneto lend you cash, you are going to getit for a couple of per cent a year.Meanwhile, in India the bank baserate is 6.5 per cent, and even that ishistorically low.Wow the anestian 3c in ann ick\n",

Not only is there a Full Moon, butthe Sun opposes Mars as Mercury arrives ata station. There is potential for strongemotional reaction. Whilst not affecting eitherthe relationship or emotional axis of yoursolar chart, being in the proximity ofdisharmony would surely be unsettling. Youmight then have reason to be particularlygrateful to those born under the water signsof Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces who may bebetter able to see this as all part of life's richtapestry. With your own ruling planet Venusopposing Mars mid-week, the focus turns toimproving communications within long-termrelationships and moving slowly but steadilyforward on any new ones. Hold the thoughtthat the cosmic weather will improve but thatfor now, your ability to keep your scalesbalanced will be tested.\n",

      "734143833567580161 May 9, 2016To the Eaitors of the New York Times Magazine:Recently, apologists for prostitution have taken to calling themselves feministsand have promoted selling sex as liberation for women. Bazelon’s informants,advocates of this peculiar brand of freedom, are almost exclusively white, over48, and self-employed. They can choose the time, the place, and the numberof clients they will service, and they get to keep the money they make. Thissanitized view of prostitution bears litle relation to the reality ofthe sex trade. Infact, women of color are the majority of those in prostitution worldwide, mostgirls enter prostitution in adolescence, not as adults, and some 80-90% ofwomen in prostitution are under third party control or pimped or trafficked.‘These women suffer extremes of degradation and violence that no tree‘woman would choose.For many years, | was the training director in a treatment program for patientswith psychological trauma. A considerable number of our patients reportedhistories of having been used in prostitution. These were among the mostseverely traumatized people we saw, and they suffered from extreme forms ofPTSD. The stories they told were horrifying, even to our seasoned clinicianswho had borne witness to many horrors.So no, prostitution should not be a crime, not for the “sex worker” | sympathizewith those women who join the sex-worker's movement as a “rebellionagainst punishment and shame.” But the sex industry, which trafics in humanbeings, is another matter entirely. Bazelon barely mentions the Nordic model,which decriminalizes the prostituted person but criminalizes the procurer andthe buyer, and she quickly dismisses any evidence that this approach might besuccessful. In fact there are many good reasons why this promising modelhas been adopted by an increasing number of countries each year. Any fairtreatment of this issue would require serious attention to an approach thataddresses the exploitation inherent in the real world of prostitution,Tm an old lady, and litle shocks me these days, but have to admit | wasshocked that the New York Times would lend itself to such a blatant brief forcommercial sex. thats liberation, spare me.Sincerely,Judith L.

Russia’s goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process,denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assessPutin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump. Wehave high confidence in these judgments.e Wealso assess Putin and the Russian Government aspired to help President-elect Trump’selection chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting herunfavorably to him. All three agencies agree with this judgment. CIA and FBI have high confidencein this judgment; NSA has moderate confidence.¢ Moscow's approach evolved over the course of the campaign based on Russia's understanding of theelectoral prospects of the two main candidates. When it appeared to Moscow that Secretary Clintonwas likely to win the election, the Russian influence campaign began to focus more on underminingher future presidency.e Further information has come to light since Election Day that, when combined with Russian behaviorsince early November 2016, increases our confidence in our assessments of Russian motivations andgoals.\n",

As statedin the 1976 Hyde Amendment, federal fundsDO NOT cover elective abortions. Federalfunds are allocated to reproductive healthcare (for women AND men).This means that defunding PP would notstop abortions. That's been true for 40years. Federal funds don't cover abortions.It WOULD, however, stop women fromaccessing birth control, STD treatment andtesting, cancer screenings, breast exams,etc (the areas that actually receive gov'tfunding).Preventing women from accessing lifesaving health care (while abortionscontinue, same as before) doesn't soundvery pro-life to me.\n",

Do you?When Trump purchased and rebuilt Mar-A-Lago the Grandmansion and estate In Palm beach, Florida he got into adispute with the city, who are well known for being strict onzoning regulations. Trump put up a 50 foot flag pole eventhough 30 foot is the maximum allowed. The cityimposed a 1,000 dollar fine per day. While Trump and thecity argued back and forth, finally when the fine hadreached 120,000 dollars Trump proposed a solution. Hewould donate that amount to veterans organizations,would move the flag and pole to a different location infront of the mansion and would only use a 30 foot flagPole. The city agreed. So Trump brought in the companywho does Golf course construction had them build a 20foot high grassy hill and put a 30 foot flag pole on top ofthat.\n",

We seriouslybelieve that it is more appropriate for our tikanga (customary rituals) to be conducted in such a mannerwhereby your Maori Representatives speak or mihi on the Prime Ministers behalf during the powhiri,pay their respects to Tangata Whenua, and then at the conclusion of the powhiri process we will providea stage and forum for the Prime Minister to engage with Ngapuhi, address the Nation and talk politicsfreely and uninhibited, if he so wishes. Therefore, it will be a 2 stage process. 1 — Powhiri/MihiWhakatau. 2 — Public Presentations. This aligns with our normal practise or standard procedure that weusually follow throughout the year.\n",

      "818245847779446785 I want to use my birthday for something that I care about very much.I’m going to talk serious about mental health. Most people probablydon’t want to read it but I feel like it’s a good insight, at least intomy mind.I know there’s this big meme where it’s funny to “be depressed”. Ienjoy the jokes, I’m not going to lie, but these jokes make it hard forpeople to be able to come out and talk about their mental issues andbe taken seriously. I’ve personally done this too. I want people to beable to at least try to talk about what’s going on in their head.I know it’s hard for me to describe my depression to people unlessthey’ve gone through something similar. The closest I can come upwith is saying it’s this feeling of near complete loneliness nearlyeveryday or everyday. It’s especially hard when you’re aroundfriends or family and they just don’t get that it’s not that their notenough, it’s something else. There’s really nothing anyone can do tohelp you. This doesn’t feel like a regular emotion. You can’t flip iton or off at will.I wanted to type this all up to reach out to everyone. If you’reseriously feeling wrong or anything like that; please reach out tome(DM me and I can get you any of my contact information) orsomeone you feel comfortable talking about it with. You shouldn’tkeep these feelings wrapped up inside of you. We want to help you.And to those not suffering from a mental illness, try to help yourloved ones that do. If you don’t think you’ll be enough, talk to themabout therapy. Somedays we don’t need help but other days we needall the help we can get, and you can’t really choose which days willbe which.\n",

The things that set you apart fromthe pack, the things that you once thought wereyour weaknesses will someday become yourstrengths. So if they say you're weird orannoying or strange or too this or not enoughthat, maybe it’s because you threaten them.Maybe you threaten them because you're notthe norm.

No one has the right to criticizeyou for how your body looks, but they will. Onething I’ve learned from experiencing this exactkind of criticism is that no one else can labelyour body except for you.

It’s thehealthiest thing that’s happened to us. | mean, | grew up in an era when the mostpowerful entity in the economics of journalism was advertising. And newspapersdidn’t know much about what readers wanted. Their economics were driven bywhat advertisers wanted. And now the economics of a place like The New YorkTimes are almost the total reverse. Readers pay our bills more than they everhave. We have to listen to them — and I'd really, really rather be listening to agroup of readers, even if they’re mad at me, than a group of advertisers whomight be mad at me. They have much, much more power. And | think that’s like,as much as we complain about the changing economics of the business, which,you know, makes us all nervous, that’s a good thing.

Police are frustrated withState Government policies that ties their hands. They are also frustrated by Labor's watering downof previous affective crime prevention policies.\"Online crime prevention groups, have revealed a lack of respect for police and the courts, even tothe point where those charged, arrived at court in a stolen vehicle, Others antagonise police bydoing donuts, tagging, mooning and driving down the wrong side of the road, knowing police cannot give chase because of the Labor Parties ‘no pursuit policy’, Police believe discretionary pursuitis necessary, in a form similar to NSW.“In light of the information received, | am demanding a ‘Please Explain' from the QueenslandPremier, because if this is the case, | will call upon her to stop the mass release of juvenileoffenders from the Cleveland Youth Detention Centre.\"“The residents of Townsville and surrounding areas will not accept this and nor should they.Escalating crime is having an impact on the community, with some people choosing to leave theregion and many afraid for their personal safety.\"Senator Hanson has this morning informed Townsville Mayor Jenny Hill of the State Governments.plans after meeting her and CEO of the Townsville City Council yesterday and giving acommitment to help curb the regions crime.\"| also met with an organisation that hopes to set up a pilot programme that will address the out ofcontrol indigenous crime, with the intention of stopping youth from continuing a life of lockup. Ouryouth detention centres are a joke, unworkable and out control. If offenders don’t get what theywant in lockup, they riot, smash TV's and cost taxpayers millions of dollars“I'm calling on the Premier to protect the innocent, give the police and parents powers to do theirjob and demand the courts hand out sentencing and non-bail conditions that fit the crime. Do yourjob Premier, otherwise after the next election One Nation will do it for you.\"---END---\n",

Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, todayreleased the following statement after Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson’s confirmation hearing:“[’ve been impressed by the answers Mr. Tillerson has given me both in our private conversations and attoday’s hearing. I am encouraged by his view that a new authorization for the use of military force (AUME)would help defeat ISIS and agree that America is strongest when it speaks with one voice. More broadly, Ibelieve Mr. Tillerson has a keen ability to recognize America’s strategic interests and the skills to advancethose interests as Secretary of State.”\n",

      "819326894483079169 mam damhowellThe Fifth Harmony fandom is mad at Camila for saying that she feltuncomfortable being sexualized when she was younger (even UNDERAGED).Somehow because Camila said that she didn’t like her sexuality being out of herhands & being forced by management to show more skin/be more provocativeshes a bitch? And yall call yourselves feminists?Also she even said that its important for women to be able to control their ownsexuality & feel comfortable with herself. So don’t throw Bad Tings at her face orcall her a slut shamer?? She literally just didn’t want to be sexualized by grownass men without her will.Saying that Camila doesn’t have a right to complain about being forciblysexualized because of her song leaves a bad taste in my mouth, and it shouldleave one in yours too. This is the same argument people give while rapinggirls/prostitutes, like “oh she willingly had sex once, so now she must always bewilling’? Just because Camila wrote a song about sex does not mean that she issuddenly allowed to be sexualized without her permission.Ariana Grande fans could understand this, but Fifth Harmony fans? All they careabout is hating Camila, and they are willing to throw their feminist ideals underthe bus to do it.\n",

ThisMuslim Empire had acted as a rampart against Russian influencespreading southwards. The British now decided to recruit the Arabsfreed from Ottoman rule for the Great Game. The exploits ofT.E. Lawrence provide a glimpse into how British agents rallied thedesert Arabs. Britain carved out the states of Saudi Arabia, Iraq andJordan from the srentn aries ie nein pire and establishedmore direct control over the territories on the southern side of the~ Persian Gulf, then known as the Trucial States (now called theEmirates). The British presence in the Trucial States was partlfinanced by the British Government of India, to which the Britishpolitical agents posted in these territories also reported. To createthe kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Saudi family was brought from theNedj desert and installed in power to rule a large part of the ArabianPeninsula and also to guard the holy places.

During the past onehundred days, | have given a lot of thought to Justina Pelletier and the horrific abuse thatthousands of institutionalized children just like her face every day. I’ve also thought a lotabout the power of Boston Children’s Hospital and how those corrupt medical staff whoabused Justina — who conspired to take her away from her parents, are presently free,walking the halls of Bader 5, the psych ward, likely repeating the same offense to the nextchild. And finally, | have thought a bit about US Attorney Carmen Ortiz — and the legacy shewill leave behind — a legacy built on fear, intimidation, and rebuke. Whether from a federalappeals court or the residents of Boston, Carmen Ortiz can’t leave office soon enough. Theonly justice affiliated with her is the fact that she is now leaving. We should honor and say aprayer today to the families of Jonathan James and Aaron Swartz, two others tormented byOrtiz who died far too early. To those who have supported Justina and the cause of haltingthe abuse of institutionalized children, | have one message — stay strong and don’t giveup! If we weaken and cave, the Carmen Ortiz’s and abusers of the world win. And that’swhy as of today, | am ending my hunger strike - to gain strength so that | can maintain theability and God-given right to continue to fight and defend those who cannot defendthemselves — the children.

My whole family came overand were in the stands and to come on and scorewith my first touch was just incredible.It was nice to come out with the win and that gamemeant a lot to me for a number of reasons.Brechin 1-2 Rangers aetTweet link\n",

Sorry.Edit to add: Downvote away. It doesn't change the fact that politicians don't give a damn about us, as evidenced bytheir decision today tovote down a measure that would have allowed people to import less expensive medications from Canada. So not onlyare we all going to lose the healthcare option we had through the ACA (insufficient though it was). We've also lost theonly other means to getting affordable medications.Democrats, Republicans. Doesn't matter. They care about their donors. They don't care about you.

The fact thatthese corporations are allowed to trade &not pay is an indictment on our politicians present & past.This issue has been allowed to evolve. It screws thenation's tax integrity, dramatically reduces revenue andplaces the burden of funding society's needs on others whodo pay tax. There is very little oversight of the relationshipsthat enable this to take place. This is incredibly unfair onsmall companies & businesses trying to compete with bigcorporations.

      "820050366041624576 Q _ You talked about this process about presidential clemency. | just wanted to dive into that just a litle bit. Today, WikiLeaks had a tweet that indicated that Julian Assange wouldagree to U.S. extradition if Chelsea Manning was granted a commutation of her sentence. There's also a petition out there that calls for the pardon of Edward Snowden: it has over amillion signatures. I'm wondering if those sorts of extraneous factors have any sort of bearing at all on the President's decision when he ultimately decides on these cases.MR. EARNEST: Well, what I can tell you is that the Department of Justice and the President will consider individual clemency applications on their merits. And there are obviouslya wide range of factors that the President and the Department of Justice will consider. And | think to illustrate one of them would be to illustrate the pretty stark difference betweenChelsea Manning and Edward Snowden.Chelsea Manning is somebody who went through the military criminal justice process, was exposed to due process, was found guilty, was sentenced for her crimes, and sheacknowledged wrongdoing. Mr. Snowden fled into the arms of an adversary, and has sought refuge in a country that most recently made a concerted effort to undermine confidence inour democracy.So | think the situation of these two individuals is quite different. | can't speculate at this point about to what degree that will have an impact on the President's consideration ofclemency requests. But | know that there's a temptation because the crimes were relatively similar to lump the two cases together. But there are some important differences, includingthe scale of the crimes that were committed and the consequences of their crimes,Obviously, as Chelsea Manning has acknowledged, and as we have said many times, that the release of the information that she provided to WikiLeaks was damaging to nationalsecurity. But the disclosures by Edward Snowden were far more serious and far more dangerous.Q__ Just one quick question, a follow-up on that. Does the Department of Justice come forward with a recommendation on each case to recommend to the President? Or does heultimately take that with heavy weight? Or how does it work?MR. EARNEST: The Department of Justice does administer a process where they will review factors about each case individually. They'll do so based on the merits, and they willprovide a recommendation to the President. And | think you would expect the President would very carefully consider the recommendation that's made by the Department of Justicebefore making a final decision.\n",

Capitol Building‘Washington, D.C. 20515Dear Majorigy Leeder McCarthy:I write today in response to your request for recommendations regarding potential federal‘changes to the Affordable Care Act.‘Asa result of federal health care reform, 5 million more Californians now have health insurance.‘The uninsured rate in California has gone down from 17.2 percent in 2013 to a historic low of7.4 percent in 2016. Equally impressive, California has created competitive markets in ourexchange — Covered California — and in Medi-Cal, resulting in lower costs, increased efficiencyand improved quality. This reduced the ever-rising growth of medical insurance premiums to 4.5percent in 2015 — far below the average annual growth of 8.8 percent in the decade before theAffordable Care Act.Repealing the Affordable Care Act with no real replacement won’t just leave millions of peoplewithout care; it will destabilize the commercial market for small business owners andindividuals. In a collapsing market, these business owners and individuals could face significantpremium increases, out of reach for many.Going back to a system where the only available care is in an emergency room is not smart. This‘will make our communities less healthy and drive up the cost of care forall of us, particularly inTulare, Kern and Los Angeles Counties where the number of Medi-Cal enrollees is high.California stands ready to work with you and your colleagues to find decent and real solutions.But | implore you: don’t just shift billions of dollars in costs to the states. That would be a verycynical way to prop up the federal budget — and devastating to millions of Americans.AIUND G. BROWN JR, ¢ SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA 95814 + (916) 445-2841~~\n",

Capitol Building‘Washington, D.C. 20515Dear Majoriy Leader McCarthy:I write today in response to your request for recommendations regarding potential federal‘changes to the Affordable Care Act.‘Asa result of federal health care reform, 5 million more Californians now have health insurance.‘The uninsured rate in California has gone down from 17.2 percent in 2013 to a historic low of7.4 percent in 2016. Equally impressive, California has created competitive markets in ourexchange — Covered California — and in Medi-Cal, resulting in lower costs, increased efficiencyand improved quality. This reduced the ever-rising growth of medical insurance premiums to 4.5percent in 2015 — far below the average annual growth of 8.8 percent in the decade before theAffordable Care Act.Repealing the Affordable Care Act with no real replacement won’t just leave millions of peoplewithout care; it will destabilize the commercial market for small business owners andindividuals. In a collapsing market, these business owners and individuals could face significantpremium increases, out of reach for many.Going back to a system where the only available care is in an emergency room is not smart. Thiswill make our communities less healthy and drive up the cost of care forall of us, particularly inTulare, Kern and Los Angeles Counties where the number of Medi-Cal enrollees is high.California stands ready to work with you and your colleagues to find decent and real solutions.But I implore you: don’t just shift billions of dottars in costs to the states. That would be a verycynical way to prop up the federal budget — and devastating to millions of Americans.Since,pron\n",

I blame the focus on Russia, largely. The hacks were afactor, but how much of a factor? And why not focus on the things thatDemocrats have control over?”\n",

A lifetime seems to have passed in minutes.Three children haye become adults since a phone call withJo Rowling, containing one small clue, persuaded me thatthere was more to Snape than an unchanging costume, andthat even though only three of the books were out at thattime, she held the entire massive but delicate narrative in,the surest of hands.Itis an ancient need to be told stories. But the storyneeds a great storyteller. Thanks for all of it, Jo.ALAN RICKMAN\n",

Books were stupid, andnone stupider than novels. But then he remembered onethat had affected him deeply. It was about a singerremembering his wedding with his girlfriend, and alsoher death after their marriage. She was a beautiful girl, amodel. Her wedding dress was short in front. Heidentified with the singer and his pain. Novels gave youempathy and empathy was what he was filled with, ifthat’s what was needed to feel superior to other people.Later on, an employee told him the novel he wasdescribing was actually the video for Guns N’ Roses’“November Rain.” He stared at the man. “It was abook,” he said. “A novel.” He turned and marched awayfrom the suddenly unemployed naysayer.(©2017 Ben Greenman/Stupid Ideas\n",

Instead of treating it as incumbent on individuals to resolve their ownpsychological distress, instead, that is, of accepting the vast privatization of stress that has taken placeover the last thirty years, we need to ask: how has it become acceptable that so many people, andespecially so many young people, are ill? The ‘mental health plague’ in capitalist societies wouldsuggest that, instead of being the only social system that works, capitalism is inherentlydysfunctional, and that the cost of it appearing to work is very high.”\n",

      "820414022348603392 1976: Respect For Each OtherLonny Price, Actor/Director/WriterMy only tradition that I always do on shows is that on the first day of rehearsal, I remind people how lucky weare to be doing this, and that there’s a long line of people who would love to be here, and that we must haverespect for what we're doing because people don’t get to do it. I think it’s a privilege to be here, and I expecteveryone to treat this show with that kind of respect. Just that. That’s the speech all the time.It's not just “don’t be late” but “have respect for each other” and “have respect that there are a lot of people whoare waiting tables who wish they were here so let’s honor them by being truly grateful.” That’s something that Ido on every show.Ijust know that everyone is so important. What I learned from Hal Prince and Steve Sondheim, when I wasworking on Pacific Overtures as the gofer, is that everybody is needed. The stage door man is to be respected asis the woman who beads the clothes in the afternoon as is the star. Everybody gets treated the same, with thesame kind of respect. They exhibited that every moment I was around them. They still do. That was somethingthat impressed me greatly.The thing about Hal is that when | first started directing, he was doing Phantom and I was doing a show in thebasement of a supermarket on 28th Street, and he'd say, “Lonny! How’s your show going?” as though we wereboth doing the same thing. He always made me feel like we were both directors and we both had the sameproblems. It didn’t matter that his show cost ten million dollars and I paid $4.50 for my set. Those men taughtme to respect everybody and that stuck.\n",

      "820414895199952896 MY THOUGHTS ON THE SITUATION.It's a matter of morals. Everyone on this site thinks they're so fucking prestigious andbecause they hide behind the walls of the internet they think they can target who ever thefuck they want. Halsey is fucking brilliant BECAUSE she Is so expressive, BECAUSE she is‘so emotional. BECAUSE she chooses to speak her mind. And everyone thinks becauseshe's famous she's this artificial being that can't be hurt - that she’s stone, But she's fleshand blood like the rest of us. And society and social media + stan culture doesn't care forfeelings. People are constantly attacked for their medical ilinesses (often being labeled asbeing extra), their sexualities, gender identities, self expression, art, race, religion. -ANYTHING that makes something that isn't static. ANYTHING that makes you opinionatedin any way shape or form. All people want is to be “iconic” and to drag people and oftentime the drags are invalid. It's selfish: all for the sake of self interest. For looking cool. Fortrying to gain popularity or be \"clever\" or “edgy”. Everyone's so afraid of themselves andthey use their own insecurities and fears against others who they think can take it ordeserve to take it because they don't realize this isn’t just pixels and light - It's a windowthat connects you DIRECTLY to someone. It's real. I's targeted harassment. It's disgusting.THIS IS ONCE AGAIN A MATTER OF MORALS.BULLYING IS REAL.CYBERBULLYING IS REAL,PEOPLE KILL THEMSELVES OVER THIS SHIT.IT IS SERIOUS AND IT NEEDS TO BE TREATED IN SUCH A MANNER.If your life revolves around sending people hate and targeting them and doing this all for thesake of getting off on it and trying to prove something only to benefit you selfish needs:PLEASE - reconsider and reevaluate your entire life. Go get a job. Got read a book. Go geta degree. Go be famous and see what it's like yourself. Work hard. Focus on YOU. Because‘YOU are the one who matters. This is YOUR life. Treat it like It's worth the space you'retaking up on this planet.\"We are each of us angels with only one wing, and we can only fly by embracing oneNext time you complain about how shit the world is - do your part. Make it better by livingby love and treating people with respect. Love Is a universal truth and it’s abundant. It ishealing. It is respect. Itis the light the world needs right now.vox La. / hoeslay / Jose Medrano.Please love one another.\n",

      "820418820808523777 Rule #3: Institutions will not save you. It took Putin a year to take over the Russianmedia and four years to dismantle its electoral system; the judiciary collapsedunnoticed. The capture of institutions in Turkey has been carried out even faster, by aman once celebrated as the democrat to lead Turkey into the EU. Poland has in lessthan a year undone half of a quarter century’s accomplishments in building aconstitutional democracy.Of course, the United States has much stronger institutions than Germany did in the1930s, or Russia does today. Both Clinton and Obama in their speeches stressed theimportance and strength of these institutions. The problem, however, is that many ofthese institutions are enshrined in political culture rather than in law, and all of them—including the ones enshrined in law—depend on the good faith of all actors to fulfilltheir purpose and uphold the Constitution.The national press is likely to be among the first institutional victims of Trumpism.There is no law that requires the presidential administration to hold daily briefings,none that guarantees media access to the White House. Many journalists may soon facea dilemma long familiar to those of us who have worked under autocracies: fall in lineor forfeit access. There is no good solution (even if there is a right answer), forjournalism is difficult and sometimes impossible without access to information.\n",

      "820781722505768961 eSan,President Trump: The Inauguration4pm, BBC One/ STVAfter a long absence, The Twilight Zone returns with’ one of the most ambitious, expensive and controversialproductions in broadcast history. Sci-fi writers havedabbled often with alternative history stories - amongthe most common is the “What If The Nazis HadWon The Second World War\" setting — but this hugeinteractive virtual reality Project, which will unfold onTV, in the press, and on Twitter over the next four years,sets out to build an ongoing alternative present. Thestory begins in a nightmarish version of 2017 in whichhuge sections of the US electorate have somehow beenduped into voting to make Donald Trump president.It sounds far-fetched, and it is, but as it goes on itbecomes more and more chillingly plausible. Today'sfeature-length opener concentrates on the gaudyinauguration of President Trump, and the stirrings ofprotest and despair surrounding the ceremony, whilepundits speculate gravely on what lies ahead. It’s aflawed piece, but a disturbing glimpse of the horrors wecould stumble into, if we're not careful.Urban7pm, §This nestoriesbasis |involvethe saand None oenchi1993unanStewmixhis carouaskebut:And(Patdrin\n",

Do not link to or share or click on articles clearly promoting the show4. Do not watch teasers or promos or trailers or use the official #The100 hashtag5. Do not discuss general episode content or current characters on show dayWhat To Do. DO KEEP TALKING ABOUT LEXA AND CLEXA USING CORRECT SPELLING*. Do continue to use Lexa and Clexa hashtags to stay visible and relevant (it’s NOT promo). Do continue to respond to and name tag writers, etc to let them know your critical opinion. Do continue to vote in Lexa and Clexa relevant polls (think Lexa/Clexa vs. The 100). Do continue to leave critical reviews and rate the show on IMDB, Netflix, etc. Do spread the word on Twitter, other social media platforms, word of mouth, etcPOON*Without going in-depth about Nielsen Social Content Ratings, their daily and weekly charts only cover the overallnumber of unique accounts and original posts along with the engagement during the show and 3 hours before andafter. These metrics not only take into account the official show handle and hashtag but also include characters,talent and related phrases, etc. Nielsen's comprehensive measurement service however provides both the TVindustry and advertisers with much more detailed metrics, including keyword and sentiment analysis. Which meansthat while Lexa and Clexa MAY be picked up and count towards their daily and weekly charts IF used during theshow and 3 hours before and after, the more detailed metrics will show exactly how significant and relevant theconversation about Lexa and Clexa still is and whether the sentiment is positive or negative towards the show.Apart from the quantifiable version of reality, the following is much MORE IMPORTANT:a) Without our negative feedback, all that is left to read about the show on social media will bepositive and mostly Bellarke-centric (rating on IMDB also gives the show clicks, a necessary evil)b) Without us talking about Lexa and Clexa, all that is left to find about them are negativecomments or nothing at all, which will make them irrelevant and possibly ruin any chances for aspinoff (no searchable/measurable Lexa mentions suggests nobody is interested in her anymore)Any critical article raises awareness about and provides coverage for the show but is absolutely vital to havepublished and shared to provide the necessary balance to promotional articles. Same goes for our tweets;the buzz they create is necessary because without our critical point of view, it would tell an unbalanced,incomplete story favoring the show! The show will not be renewed solely based on overall mentions andgeneral buzz, but it will Continue to struggle and might fail because of the NEGATIVE AND CRITICAL buzzstil surrounding it\n",

Do they care about your future?Seeing someone attractive is one thing, seeing their mind attractive is anotherThat is love, all of the things above.Infatuation, all the things below, if you catch what | throw.Sex and touching, yes can all be a part of love, but it’s not just about that.People use sex to fill a voidYes it may work for a while but later you will want something more, something intenseSomething that doesn’t make you flinch“We're just friends” those words slip out without even thinking about it,Little does anyone know that’s not what’s going on behind closed doors.Touching and feeling and getting to know their body, but not their mind is a wild thingYou want love right? What's stopping you from it?Learn before you get under clothes that you need to get under the mind first.Give them multiple mind-gasms while going down on their thoughts.We all talk about love, like its what we want, but we don’t even try to figure someone out\n",

I know they force it down your throat until you choke on it.Girls aren’t pretty unless they’re wanted. Boys aren’t men unlessthey’re having sex with someone. People aren’t lovable until they’redating someone.But a relationship won’t always make you happy, and as wonderful asromance is, it isn’t the only love that exists. I have seen friendshipsthat are deeper and more pure than couples who swear it’s forever -and yet the friendship is the one people ignore.Thave heard so often “nobody loves me” out of the mouths of peoplewho are single. And it kills me because if you ask them: where areyour parents, your teachers, your classmates, your pets - they say, yes,okay, but it doesn’t count. Of course it counts, love doesn’t diminishjust because someone doesn’t want to have sex with you. In fact,doesn’t it sort of make that love more real that they want nothing -not even a date - out of you?It is pretty to be in love. It’s magical, I’m sure. But it’s also wonderfulto stop for ice cream in your prom dress with six other girls. It’s alsowonderful to go visit the world with nothing but a bunch of buddieswho are really excited about learning.The problem is: we’ve made everything about “the one”. But maybe“the one” is just you, loving yourself, having fun, and being happy.Maybe instead of looking for our other halves, we should be piecingourselves together.Maybe I wasn’t born unfinished. Maybe I am the one who makesmyself better.”\n",

      "822223226574995456 Sarah Kendzior, a journalist and an expertscholar on authoritarian states, talks toJoy-Ann Reid and warns: America is notimmune to kleptocracy and authoritharianrule.\"| think it's important that Americans realize this can happen here, thatthis is something that has happened in countries all over the world andwe are not immune. Trump has laid out his intentions very clearlythroughout his campaign. His slogan might have been ‘America First’ —which of course is a throw back to fascism — but it's really 'America Last’And who comes first is Trump and his family. All the incidences you justdescribed of installing his family within the Administration, not divorcinghis business interest from the government, not disclosing his taxreturns — those are all signs of kleptocracy. Kleptocracy often goeshand-in-hand with authoritarian rule. You see this in particular in Russiaand in other post-Soviet authoritarian states in which the person inpower can abuse executive laws, can often rewrite laws, in order to keepthat financial benefit flowing. And so we are much more vulnerable thanwe think. Our systems of checks and balances, of legal procedures maynot hold when somebody whose primary goal is to personally benefithimself by stripping down the state to its parts is in charge and is ableto override some of those regulations.\"MSNBC, amJoy, November 27, 2016\n",

This inauguration legitimizesan election that was won by dehumanizing you.Do not offer personal information to strangers.Stay to the edges of the crowd.This makes it easier to disperse in case of arrests; it also makes it easier to take a rest.If you’re black, you'll be disproportionately targeted for police violence and arrest.If you're undocumented, any arrest can result in serious legal troubles.Ifyou’re a green card holder, any arrest will have to be listedand explained on any future citizenship application.Ifyou’re trans/gender non-conforming and are arrested, you will likely be placed witha gender you don't identify with. On purpose.If you're disabled and are arrested, you may be placed in an un-accessible cell.Have a meet-up-if-you-get-separated plan that’s accessible to everyone in your group.Do not count on your cellphones — they can get jammed, lose signal, and/or lose battery.‘Write important information (like legal aid, emergency contact,and drug allergies) on your forearm in Sharpie.In fact, bring a Sharpie with you to share with others for this purpose.Bring water and stay hydrated.Bring healthy AND sugary snacks and eat what feels right.Keep in mind that accessible toilets are more difficult to find.If you're walking, wear comfortable shoes and a backpack.If you're using a wheelchair, carry your bag with you in the front if possible.Don't bring anything you can't stand to lose.‘Calmly leave the vicinity if you have any doubts about anything.(These are intended to be peaceful gatherings but it’s likely that infiltrators will try toincite violence and make it look like the protestors caused it. Use your own judgment.)‘Remember that we need you to return home safely.Pass it along.\n",

We need more films where actressesplay sisters. 2015 had Sidharth Malhotra and Akshay Kumar (Brothers), Varun Dhawan andShah Rukh (Dilwale) and 2016 had Sid again, this time with Fawad Khan (Kapoor & Sons)in bhai-bhai mode, while only Kriti Sanon and Kajol (Dilwale) played sisters in recenttimes. When asked, here’s who some of the actresses we spoke to wanted as their screen sibling...@TeamDeepikaMYKriti Sanon| will probably choose Deepika. |hardly had one or two shots withher in the song she has done for mynext film Raabta. She is super funand has great energy on the sets.And of course, she’s also tall andhas a similar body structure, so itwill be easier for us to play sisters.\n",

      "822226256347406342 TRUMP:Thank you very much. Thank you very much everybody, and thank you Tom. I'd like to congratulateour incredible entertainers tonight. Toby, and Lee Greenwood and all of the great talent. It wasreally very special. | also have to thank our incredible military right here. Thank you. Stand up,please. You guys were really great. Thank you. So this journey began 18 months ago. | had somethingto do with it, but you had much more to do with it than | did. I'm the messenger. I'm just themessenger. And we were tired. And I love you. Believe me, | love you. We all got tired of seeing whatwas happening. And we wanted change, but we wanted real change. And | look so forward totomorrow. We're going to see something that is going to be so amazing. So many people havepoured into Washington, D.C.This started out tonight being a small little concert, and then we had the idea maybe we'll do it infront of the Lincoln Memorial. | don't know if it's ever been done before. But if it has, very seldom.And the people came by the thousands and thousands, and here we are tonight, all the way back. Allthe way back. So it's a movement that began, it's a movement that started, and it's a movement likewe've never seen anywhere in the world, they say. There's never been a movement like this and it'ssomething very, very special. And we're going to unify our country, and our phrase — you all know it,half of you are wearing the hat — \"Make America Great Again.\" But we're going to make Americagreat for all of our people, everybody. Everybody throughout our country. That includes the innercities, that includes everybody. And we're going to do a special job, and | can only tell you that 18months ago, we never knew, a lot of people didn't know, some people had a feeling. A lot of peopledidn't give us much of a chance, but we understood what was happening. And that last month of thecampaign, when | traveled around to every place that you can imagine. State after state after state,speech after speech. And we had ten thousand, twenty thousand, thirty thousand people. There wasnever an empty seat, just like tonight. We didn't know if anybody would even come tonight. Thishasn't been done before. And you look. It was the same way. And we all knew that last month of thecampaign. | think a lot of us knew the first week of the campaign, but that last month of thecampaign we knew that something special was happening.And | can only tell you this: The polls started going up, up, up, but they didn't want to give us credit.Because they forgot about a lot of us. On the campaign | called it \"the forgotten man” and \"theforgotten woman.\" Well, you're not forgotten anymore. That | can tell you. Not forgotten anymore.So | want to thank my great family, my incredible wife Melania. They've been so supportive, and itwasn't easy for them. But they have been so supportive. | want to thank you, most importantly. And| promise you that | will work so hard. We're going to get it turned around. We're going to get ourjobs back. We're not going to let other countries take our jobs any longer. We're going to build upour great military. We're going to build it up. We're going to strengthen our borders. We're going todo things that haven't been done for our country for many, many decades. It's going to change. |promise you it's going to change.So I'll see you tomorrow. And | don't care frankly if it's going to be beautiful or if it's going to rain likecrazy. Makes no difference to me. | have a feeling it's going to be beautiful. But | will see youtomorrow, and I'm going to be cheering you on. You're going to cheer me on, but I'm going to becheering you on. Because what we've done is so special. All over the world they're talking about it.All over the world. And | love you folks, and we're going to work together. And we are going to —make America great again. And I'll add: Greater than ever before! Thank you very much and enjoythe fireworks. Thank you everybody. Thank you.\n",

Not that he isn't a figurehead, or that his main function isn't probablymostly cultural, but that it doesn't matter.It does matter. A symbol matters. Having a President that over and over againdemonstrated a deep ability to feel and care mattered to me personally. Affirmingempathy and patience and understanding at the highest level, even if it was just as asymbol, mattered to me. | know that his Presidency wasn't perfect, and | don'tendorse (or more honestly know) everything that he and his administration did, but |do endorse and celebrate what | know he did do, and what | had earlier dismissed asperipheral and unimportant: be a public example of a good person. | had, for a longtime, believed that any public display of kindness by a politician was a calculatedmove to obscure some hidden agenda or simplify a more complex issue. And | stillbelieve it can and will be leveraged like that by some. But when | watched Obamaspeak, whether after Sandy Hook or at the funeral of Clementa Pickney, | saw a manexpressing kindness because he was kind, sadness because he was saddened,feeling because he felt. It was impossible for me to be cynical watching him. | justbelieved him. | believed and do believe that he is a genuinely good person that thinksand feels very deeply.lam compelled to write this not from a want to assert anything, or from a needto change any minds (that's for more qualified people to attempt), but from a deep‘sense of personal gratitude | feel toward him. | believe the better parts of me havegrown in part because | have spent the entirety of my adult life with him as myPresident.

His name:Barack Hussein Obama. The relationship that began that day would change theworld, but it was not love at first sight—at least not for Michelle. “I loved thinkingabout what was going on inside Michelle's head,” says Tika Sumpter (Ride Along),who stars opposite newcomer Parker Sawyers in this reenactment of that first date.“She had options. She was wondering, ‘Who is this hotshot?’ And what's at stake forher and for her reputation at work if she goes out with him?” Many of the events inthe film are historically accurate—Michelle and Barack did go see Do the RightThing—but Sumpter (who's also a producer) and first-time writer-director RichardTanne looked to Richard Linklater’s tender Before trilogy for the film’s relaxed tone.“We definitely were going for that same calm, walking-and-talking feel,” Sumptersays. “There are a lot of movies out in the summer with greenscreen and big effects,but we wanted this to be like a date for the audience: Sit down, put your phone away,listen, and be in the moment.” Sounds OK, Cupid. —JO£ McGOVERN\n",

Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi released the following statement on President Trump'sInauguraladdress:“This was my tenth Inauguration, my first being when | was a student attending John F. Kennedy'sInauguration. This was the first Inaugural Address that sounded more like a campaign speech.“President Trump's speech ignores eight years of economic growth under President Obama. Hisdescription of what happens in Washington in terms of the concentration of wealth sounded like anindictment of the Republicans’ trickle-down economics. I'm glad that he’s making that statement now,especially as Republicans propose new tax breaks for the wealthy. If President Trump is sincere aboutfighting against that failed trickle-down policy that has increased the deficit, caused job loss, and ransackedour investments in the future, Democrats look forward to finding common ground with him.“When President Trump talks about keeping America number one by putting our workers first and defeatingISIS, we're all with him. When President Trump talks about investments in our human infrastructure andhelping Americans balance work and family, we will work to find common ground.“However, I'm glad that President Trump did not mention an assault on the Affordable Care Act, becausethat is a place where Democrats will stand our ground. Today, we heard the rhetoric, now we must see thebudget. | always say, show me your budget, show me your values.”\n",

The President suspended a planned cut inFHA mortgage insurance premiums, which theNational Association of Realtors estimates will cost asmany as 40,000 families a shot at a new home. That's40,000 who just lost their chance to buy a homethanks to brand new President Trump.

The President suspended a planned cut inFHA mortgage insurance premiums, which theNational Association of Realtors estimates will cost asmany as 40,000 families a shot at a new home. That’s40,000 who just lost their chance to buy a homethanks to brand new President Trump. Now that he'sin office, we must measure the President by hisactions, not only his words — and what he did todaywas make it that much harder for families trying toachieve the American Dream.\n",

      "822950803577180160 Secondly, photographs of the inaugural proceedings were intentionally framed in a way in one particulartweet to minimize the enormous support that had gathered on the National Mall. This was the first time inour nation’s history that floor coverings had been used to protect the grass on the mall. That had theeffect of highlighting any areas where people were not standing, while in year's past, the grass eliminatedthis visual.This was also the first time that fencing and magnetometers went as far back on the wall preventinghundreds of thousands of people from being able to access the mall as quickly as they had ininaugurations past. Inaccurate numbers involving crowd size were also tweeted. No one had numbersbecause the National Park Service, which controls the National Mall, does not put any out. By the way,this applies to any attempts try to count the protesters today in the same fashion.We do know a few things. So let's go through the facts. We know that from the platform, where thepresident was sworn in to 4th Street pulls about 250,000 people. From 4th street to the media tent is,about another 220,000. And from the media tent to the Washington Monument, another 250,000 people,All of this space was full when the president took the oath of office. We know that 420,000 people usedthe DC Metro public transit yesterday, which actually compares to 317,000 that used it for President(Obama's last inaugural. This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration period. Both inperson and around the globe. Even the New York Times printed a photograph showing that amisrepresentation of the crowd in the original tweet, in their paper, which showed the full extent of thesupport, depth, and crowd and intensity that existed.‘These attempts to lessen the enthusiasm of the inauguration are shameful and wrong. The president wasalso at the center - as you know - the president was at the Central Intelligence Agency today and greetedby a raucous, overflow crowd of some 400 plus CIA employees. There were over 1,000 requests toattend, prompting the president to note that he'll come back to have to greet the rest. The employeeswere ecstatic that he's the new commander-in-chief and he delivered them a powerful and importantmessage - he told them, \"He has their back.\" And they were grateful for that. They gave him a five minutestanding ovation at the end in a display of their patriotism and their enthusiasm for his presidency.\n",

Wanting him to failis like wanting a pilot to crash a plane that we are ALLon. REMEMBER THAT.\"| would just like to take a second to respond:TRUST ME. None of us want the plane to go down.But you can understand why we are a little scaredbeing forced to get on a plane with a pilot who hasnever flown a plane before. And didn't even gettraining for it. And he isn't even off the ground yet andhe is already driving erratically, won't look at thesafety requirements, and has already sexuallyassaulted the flight attendants. Not to mention hewants some of the people to jump off the planebecause he doesn't want them on it.So to be clear: | HOPE we land safely. And | hope hebrings everyone the little bags of peanuts hepromised. But we aren't going to sit around for theduration of the flight with our headphones on andwatch a movie. We are going to scream the wholebumpy ride hoping he won't crash.ade tito MB Carmmant way Chara© _ Write acomment... ©iim oe\n",

The ParkService is part of the Interior Department.According to CNN, the Interior Department circulated an email toemployees on Friday saying that representatives of the Trumpadministration had ordered the shutdown.The Park Service resumed posting messages to its Twitter account bymidmorning on Saturday, apologizing for the “mistaken” retweets.\n",

      "823309292182839297 The truth is here, AQW is falling, and it’s falling quicker than we'd all like. We're all lovers of AEbased games. Personally, after talking to a friend of mine, you all know him as Paladin EdwardLepp, we've decided that maybe we can attempt to bring something to all the heads of AE,specifically Alina and Artix, the lead for AQW and the CEO of AE himself. We all love AQW, welove how they update weekly, and we've had our fair share of memories on the game, andpersonally, | want to make more! So, we (Lepp and |) talked it over, and what if we bringsomething to their attention! Like, how about bi-weekly releases instead of every week! Like ourbeloved Laken himself said (| hope you don't get upset at me for using you as an example), \"!don't want to do it anymore. Not fun making an armor every week to have it be replaced the nextweek\". AE has been pushing out releases each and every week for almost 9 whole years, workingmuch harder than some mutt-million dollar company! As talked about, we believe that if AE hadmore time to work on things via bi-weekly releases, quality would increase we could experiencewhat we all want again! The old AQWI In return for the more time to develop, maybe we canregain great items, nice, well planned out merge shops with items that didn't take three days todesign, but instead gave them a minimum of a week! Giving our beloved artists, tester, writers,designers, and staff in general the time they need to give us the best possible experience in AQW!It gives them all so much more time to give us amazing releases! We could also get longerstorylines, more in depth stories, etc!We all want AE to give us more, but in reality, quality as much better than quantity. We're askingthat the AQW team give themselves needed time to design releases as amazing as past eventsthat people look on fondly at. People are leaving because of the deteriorating quality, and we wishfor this to stop. It isn’t sound easy to constantly think of names, character designs, plots,background art, coding to make everything work, drawing items, testing the items, etc in just oneweek. Think about it guys, let all of this sink in, and think. Maybe we can get AE’s attention andmaybe we can get a nice change going, to give everyone the fun and love for AQW again!Signed, |Paladin Edward Lepp, and Frostbyte.\n",

      "823309916978806784 Three Things Every Christian owes President Trump by Bruce AshfordThe Obama era will come to an end on the morning of Friday, January 20th as Donald J. Trump is inauguratedas the 45th president of the United States of America. Christians in America are divided between those whoembrace Trump, those who oppose him, and those who take a “wait-and-see” mentality.Regardless of which category a Christian falls into, here are three things each of us owes President Trump:1. We owe him the benefit of the doubt.We owe President Trump the benefit of the doubt. For Christians who supported his candidacy, this imperativecan be taken for granted. But for others of us who did not support his candidacy, this imperative is a necessaryreminder.During the election cycle, we opposed Mr. Trump’s nomination and candidacy for a variety of reasons,including reservations about his ideological framework, policy stances, temperament, and rhetoric. Yet Mr. Trumpwas victorious, and after his inauguration, our pride might be tempted to justify our pre-inaugural opposition. It‘may be easy to interpret his post-inaugural words and works in a worse light than the evidence demands and, indoing so, say “See, | told you so.”But we owe it to President Trump and to our fellow citizens to hope that he does well, to give him the benefit ofthe doubt, to affirm him and his Cabinet when they do well for our nation. We owe it to President Trump becausehe is our President, and one of the Bible's few political imperatives is to give leaders the respect that is due totheir office (Rom 13:1-7). We also owe it to our fellow citizens not to perpetuate the dishonest, disrespectful, ardeven toxic nature of this year’s political discourse.2. We owe him our honest criticism.We owe President Trump our honest criticism. Christians who opposed his candidacy will probably have notrouble recognizing the merits of this imperative. At the same time, Christians who cheered his candidacy mightbe tempted to ignore it, to their own detriment and to the detriment of our nation.Our nation's political discourse has broken down, in part, because many citizens and commentators have givenup on politics. They've given up on the idea of politics as a bipartisan attempt to achieve the common good: Inthe place of it, they've embraced a winner-takes-all mentality that demonizes the opposition and lionizes one’s‘own party or candidate. Pro-Trumpers could be be lured into embracing everything Trump does, and agree witheverything he says.~ Sustas the kings of Egypt and Persia needed Joseph and Daniel to-speak hard truths to them (Gen-44;Dan-2};0 President Trump needs us to speak our minds with honest criticism. The Proverbs remind us that we shouldspeak the truth, even when the truth hurts, and that our truth-telling will bring healing (Prov 12:16-18). Becausewe are Christians who are committed to truth, and because we are citizens of a democratic republic in which weare encouraged to speak up for the common good, we owe him our honest criticism.‘8. We owe him our prayers.For those of us who are interested in our nation’s politics, it's easy to forget the importance of prayer. Askyourself: when is the last time you prayed for President Obama, or for members of Congress? When is the lasttime you prayed for Mr. Trump or his incoming Cabinet? For many of us the answer is, “not very often’ or “never.”But the Bible is clear that Christians should seek God's guidance for those in authority. The apostle Paul wrote tohis protégé, Timothy, “Therefore | exhort first of all that all supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving ofthanks be made for all men, for kings and all who are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable lifé inall godliness and reverence” (1 Tim 2:1-2). That's a direct command, one of the few clear imperatives the Biblegives us concerning government and politics.We should be careful not to get so caught up in discussion and debate that we forget to appeal to the Kingwho rules over the world’s rulers. “A king's heart is like streams of water in the Lord’s hand: he directs it whereverHe chooses” (Prov 22:1). Rather than trusting in a new President or in an opposing political party, we should betrusting the One in whose hands they govern,The Heart and Strength of Every Good Political MovementAs Christians, we know that Christ was raised from the dead and that he will return one day to set the worldaright. Having this knowledge, we as Christians should serve our nation by being the heart and strength of everygood movement of social, cultural, or political concern, But we can’t be the heart and strength of any goodmovement if our public life is characterized by cynical opposition, naive optimism, or apathetic spirituality,So the ball is in our court. Let’s give President Trump our benefit of the doubt, our honest criticism, and ourconsistent prayers.Bruce Ashford is the Provost and Dean of Faculty at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary, where he alsoserves as Professor of Theology and Culture.\n",

But then, Rodgers saidwe would run the table. And since thatpoint, we won 8 straight games, wereaveraging 30 points per game. We went ona run. Ended up winning the division andgetting the 4th seed in the playoffs. Beatup the Giants in the Wildcard round, beatthe #1 seed cowboys to get to the NFCChampionship. We lost to Atlanta, the bestoffense in the NFL. To get to where we didwith what we had is something to beproud of. Love my team no matter what.GO PACK GO YY\n",

It was our hope that President Trump would take the necessary steps to avoid violating the Constitution before he took office,\" CREW Executive Director Noah Bookbinder said. “He didnot. Hisconstitutional violations are immediate and serious, so we were forced to take legal action.”‘Since Trump refused to divest from his businesses, he is now getting cash and favors from foreign governments, through guests and events at his hotels leases in his buildings, and valuable realestate deals abroad. Trump does business withcounties like China, India, Indonesia and the Philippines, and now that he is President his company’s acceptance of any benefits from the governments of those countries violates the Constitution. When Trump the president sits down tonegotiate trade deals wit these countries, the American people will have no way of knowing whether he will also be thinking about the profis of Trump the businessman,“President Trump has made his slogan “America First, said Bookbinder. “So you would think he would want to strictly follow the Constitution's foreign emoluments clause, sncthinking of Americans first and not foreign governments,”it was writen to ensure our government officals are(CREW is represented inthe ease by an all-star team of top constitutional scholars ethics experts and Itigators who have combined to argue 4S cases before the Supreme Court. The lawyers onthe case include CREW’s board chair and viee-chit Norman Eisen and Richard Painter, the tp ethics lawyers for te lst two presidents, Constitutional law scholars Erwin Chemerinsky, Laurence H. Tribe and Zephyr Teachout, and Deepak Gupta of Gupta Wessler PLLC.30.\n",

Community expectation is that peopleaccused of violent offences should not be put straight back out onto our streets.The second principle is to introduce a ‘one strike and you're out policy for anyone breaching bail. If you are on bail and you breach theconditions of bail, you forfeit that privilege and face remand. For too long, breaching bail has carried no consequences.The third principle will be the reinstatement of the offence of breaching bail by juveniles which was a change that weakened our bail system in2016.No more second chances. No more excuses.And no more freedom for violent offenders that continue to break the law without any fear of the consequences or regard for human life.Bail decisions by judges and bail justices made under the current system has shown us how catastrophic these decisions have been.There is one certainty: violent offenders cannot commit horrific crimes if they are not free to roam our streets.\n",

      "823313884828340224 46% of Battery Consumption to Transfer 0.2% of Total BytesAT&T Labs Research published a great research paper (“Profiling Resource Usage forMobile Applications”) in which it analyzed a number of popular mobile applications for |network and battery efficiency. Among these applications, Pandora serves as a great casestudy for the inefficiency of intermittent network transfers on mobile networks.Whenever a Pandora user plays a song, the entire music file is streamed by the appli-cation from the network in one shot, which is the correct behavior: burst as much data| asyou can, then turn off the radio for as long as possible. However, following the music| transfer, the application would conduct periodic audience measurements by sendingintermittent analytics pings every 60 seconds. The net effect? The analytics beaconsaccounted for 0.2% of the total transferred bytes and 46% of the total power consump-tion of the application!The beacon transfers are small, but the energy tails induced by the RRC state transitionswere keeping the radio active for significantly longer, unnecessarily wasting 46% of thebattery, By coalescing the analytics data into fewer requests, or by sending the audiencedata when the radio is already active, we can eliminate the unnecessary energy tails and| almost double the power efficiency of the application!\n",

Instead of asking how we can makereparations for slavery, colonialism, and Apartheid or how wecan equalize academic scores and incomes, we should insteadbe asking questions like, \"Does human civilization actuallyneed the Black race?\" \"Is Black genocide right?\" and, if it is,\"What would be the best and easiest way to dispose of them?\"With starting points like this, wisdom is sure to flourish,enlightenment to dawn.Jason Siks@JSiks@pcvinil @amped_draws @DVSblast 1/2 He believes ina white ethno-state.

And then to be embracedand welcomed in this way is extremely overwhelming and very exciting.Contd on P4\n",

I don’t think the players are being fair to the coaching staff, because if youdon’t have the ability to play hard and implement what they are putting out there,then you are not paying attention to the details andas you should. That’s just the bottom line. This is nothigh school or college anymore. This is the real deal and they have not recognizedthat yet and it’s unfortunate because right now they are associated with not onlyhaving the worst record in Laker franchise history last season but now the worstloss. Those are two things that I would not be comfortable with that on anytime.don’t tell me you understand, ‘we need to compete, we'vegot to play together. ‘ You can’t have the same explanation after every game andthink that we're believing that.(on Spectrum SportsNet post-game broadcast)\n",

      "823316268916740097 17 at 3:47 PMThere were protests in 2008 and 2012 as well, they just weren't as organized, and (unsurprisingly)they were fueled by fear, hate, and on a bed of lies.\"Following Obama's election [in 2008], property was destroyed across the country, for example inPennsylvania, Texas, and North Carolina, and a predominately black church was torched inMassachusetts.” — via the HillAlso in 2008, \"a noose was found hanging from a tree at Baylor University in Texas. By the end ofthe [January 2008], a Wichita pastor had put up a sign on his church calling Obama a Muslim andsaid that his victory was a 'sin.'\" And, \"the Southern Poverty Law Center documented hundreds ofhate crimes against minorities by Americans outraged that a black man could be President of theUnited States.\" — via CBSNews, CNN, and NBC (collected by Romper)\"Cross burnings. Schoolchildren chanting \"Assassinate Obama.\" Black figures hung from nooses.Racial epithets scrawled on homes and cars.\" — via NBCNewsIn 2012, \"A student protest at the University of Mississippi against the re-election of PresidentObama turned disorderly on Wednesday morning... a crowd of 400 people formed at the studentunion shortly before midnight after reports of a riot spread on social media. Some students yelledracial slurs and profanity in anger over Mr. Obama’‘s re-election, the statement said. Photographsposted online showed students lighting Obama campaign signs on fire\" — via NYTimesPersonally, I'd *much* rather have (mostly) peaceful, constitutionally protected, officiallypermitted protests where marchers declare their love for America, Rights and Equality -- than theviolence, racism, lies, and prejudice perpetrated by \"whiney\" Americans in 2008 and 2012. But, |leave it to you which you’d prefer.One more thing, to whine: is to complain, it comes from “whinge” which is to complain inpersistently and in a peevish or irritating way. Like constant complaint about a president withoutany action for 8 years. Congress whined, and refused to do anything. The Right whined, andgrabbed racial epithets and prejudice. That’s whining. Whiney children throw tantrums and blameothers, because action is hard.Mature adults read the Constitution of the United States, apply for permits months in advance,and exercise their right to Freedom of Assembly. We are adults. Adults act]\n",

      "834158816501456898 Thank you, Justine Janney and Michael Landis for posting this on Facebook.| can't believe I'm saying this, but it looks like Trump is actually making America greatagain. Just look at the progress made since the election:1. Unprecedented levels of ongoing civic engagement.2. Millions of Americans now know who their state and federal representatives arewithout having to google.3. Millions of Americans are exercising more. They're holding signs and marching everyweek.4. Alec Baldwin is great again. Everyone's forgotten he's kind of a jerk.5. The Postal Service is enjoying the influx cash due to stamps purchased by millions ofpeople for letter and postcard campaigns.6. Likewise, the pharmaceutical industry is enjoying record growth in sales of anti-depressants.7. Millions of Americans now know how to call their elected officials and know exactlywhat to say to be effective.8. Footage of town hall meetings is now entertaining.9. Tens of millions of people are now correctly spelling words like emoluments,narcissist, fascist, misogynist, holocaust and cognitive dissonance.10. Everyone knows more about the rise of Hitler than they did last year.11. Everyone knows more about legislation, branches of power and how checks andbalances work.12, Marginalized groups are experiencing a surge in white allies.13. White people in record numbers have just learned that racism is not dead. (See #6)14, White people in record numbers also finally understand that Obamacare IS theAffordable Care Act.15. Stephen Colbert's \"Late Night\" finally gained the elusive #1 spot in late night talkshows, and Seth Meyers is finding his footing as today's Jon Stewart.16. \"Mike Pence\" has donated millions of dollars to Planned Parenthood since Nov. Sth.17. Melissa FREAKING McCarthy.18. Travel ban protesters put $24 million into ACLU coffers in just 48 hours, enablingthem to hire 200 more attorneys. Lawyers are now heroes.19. As people seek veracity in their news sources, respected news outlets are happilyreporting a substantial increase in subscriptions, a boon to a struggling industry vital to‘our democracy.20. Live streaming court cases and congressional sessions are now as popular as theKardashians,21. Massive cleanup of facebook friend lists.22. People are reading classic literature again. Sales of George Orwell's \"1984\"increased by 10,000% after the inauguration. (Yes, that is true. 10,000%. Sth grade Litteachers all over the country are now rock stars.)23. More than ever before, Americans are aware that education is important. Like, superimportant.\n",

The currentRevised 22 June 2015Accepted 1 July 2015Available online 17 July 2015Tesearch proposes and tests a novel theoretical model in which both the construction and interpretationof sarcasm lead to greater creativity because they activate abstract thinking. Studies 1 and 2 found thatboth sarcasm expressers and recipients reported more conflict but also demonstrated enhanced creativityfollowing a simulated sarcastic conversation or after recalling a sarcastic exchange. Study 3 demonstratedcones that sarcasm’s effect on creativity for both parties was mediated by abstract thinking and generalizespeal across different forms of sarcasm. Finally, Study 4 found that when participants expressed sarcasmConflict toward or received sarcasm from a trusted other, creativity increased but conflict did not.

Hester is the second person—after Noor Salman, the wifeof the Orlando nightclub shooter—to be arrested on material support charges by theFBI in 2017. By comparison, the FBI arrested 41 subjects on ISIL-related offenses in2016, according to George Washington University’s Program on Extremism.Like many subjects, including Harlem Suarez (whom I wrote about just last week),Hester came onto the FBI’s radar due to his extremist, ISIL-inspired social mediaposts. Using its traditional toolkit, the FBI tasked an online undercover employee toreach out to the subject online and later introduced two undercover FBI agents whomet with Hester face to face.With the help of these agents, Hester began devising a terrorist attack, cementingHis place within the ranks of native-born U.S. citizens plotting violent attackswithin the United States.

Nowbecause I've explained the situation way too many timesalready here's the condensed version.Delayed flight from Denver to Chicago. Delayed delayeddelayed delayed delayed delayed from Chicago to JFKcausing us to miss our flight from JFK to Zurich.Rebooked from JFK to London then to Zurich. Finallymake it to JFK. Find our gate. Four hours later go to geton flight and get told our tickets were cancelled byAmerican Airlines. Get lucky and find the one personworking for AA after midnight who then rebooked us ona flight today ( 03 / 25 ) from JFK to Zurich today around6. Sounds great except it's not. Nobody can tell me whyour tickets had \" dropped out of the system\" eventhough we have them printed out and on top of that |wasted money on a hotel we didn't use and wastedmoney on a flight from Zurich to Amsterdam that wecouldn't make. So we booked that flight for tonight whichwe also can't make. Luckily | was able to cancel thesecond flight but ate the cost of the first Zurich toAmsterdam. Now if by some miracle we get on the fighttonight | have to book another flight from Zurich toAmsterdam at a more expensive cost.I'm sure nobody from American Airlines will read orrespond to this but I'd be more than happy to provide alldocumentation.\n",

Thisis so sad. | know of grown men who will never be ableto go on atrip, be it for work or pleasure, if their wivesdo not pack their suitcase for them.There is an entire generation of Indian men who wouldliterally starve to death if left on their own.| always thought parents loved all their childrenequally.

Anindependent candidate, Knecht has been a member of the Peoria Unified School District governing boardsince 2006, when she defeated Lesko at the ballot in a race for the board. With two available seats on theboard up for grabs that year, former lawmaker Rick Murphy and Knecht finished first and second at theballot, respectively, leaving out Lesko. However, Lesko has never lost a race for the Legislature, starting withher first election to the Arizona House in 2008, two years after the school board defeat. The opposingcandidates have one other tie that binds them: They're neighbors. Lesko and Knecht live virtually across thestreet from one another in Peoria, according to records from the Secretary of State’s Office.\n",

      "893567578907561984 364Chapter 05In contrast to the first phase, the second phase of Indian studies in Germany (forwhich we properly reserve the name Indology) was also marked by increasing tech-nicization. Whereas the Romantics had been inspired by pedagogic and philosophi-cal considerations, such considerations were regarded as increasingly redundant bycareer Indologists. As we have seen, following Hegel's review of von Humboldt’s Gita,German scholars increasingly came to see Indian texts as raw matter for their ownhistorical and critical researches. Hence Oldenberg could now declare, “it is the taskof the philological researcher to determine these fates [which the Indian texts haveundergone], so to speak, the life history [Lebensgeschichte] of the texts.” He alsocompared Indian texts, “as they have been handed down to us,” with “the paintingsof old masters, across which destruction and attempts at restoration, both by legiti-mate and illegitimate persons, have alternately been at work.” Our aim, Oldenbergdeclared, was to “know, as far as can be recognized, what the painting originally waslike.”*° Here was where German scholarship came into its own.

Ferventancestor worship and gin can help reduce the duration.2) ‘Do not look at the sky during the eclipse. Itresents you, and its burning orb is still watching, eventhough you think it isn t. It is clever like that.3) Make sure that all farmyard animals have dark glassesand plenty of simple distractions, such as vegetable-basedpuzzles to keep their minds off the event.4) Be sure to tell children that this is what happens whenthey touch themselves down there , and that next time thesun might not come back.5) Badgers, being both black and white, are not affected byeclipses, but may try to be sick in your hat. Keep headwear.at a safe height until the eclipse is over.6) Finally, never try to photograph an eclipse. Imagine theresult of capturing an entire mass of malignancy inside asmall box.

A Federal courtmonitor was appointed to oversee his office'soperations because of complaints of racialprofiling. The U.S. Department of Justiceconcluded that Arpaio oversaw the worstpattern of racial profiling in U.S. history, andsubsequently filed suit against him forunlawful discriminatory policeconduct [citation needed]\n",
      "901489484000264192 This is Sheriff Joe Arpaio.A federal judge ruled that his jails violated theconstitutional rights of inmates.He extended his jails by creating a \"tent city,\" inwhich he himself recorded the temperatures at onepoint reaching 145 degrees Fahrenheit.He, on video, has described this tent city proudly as a \"concentration camp.\"He failed to investigate sex crimes, including deciding not to follow up on atleast 32 child molestations.He staged a fake assassination attempt in order to gain political support.The Department of Justice found \"a pervasive culture of discriminatory biasagainst Latinos\" that reached the highest levels of Arpaio's Sheriff Office.In 2012, he announced \"findings\" that President Obama's birth certificatewas forged.In 2015, he admitted violating court orders to stop racial profiling practices.He was found guilty of criminal contempt of court.This is the man that President Donald Trump choseto pardon as the nation was fixated on a horrificnatural disaster.\n",

I am aware that with thisdecision I am mercilessly excluding also a lot of good people, but all the messagesfrom guys that I got so far were by horny gays that wanted to flirt (any referenceto the tons of messages I received by hordes of Brazilian guys is purelyental).-Avoid compliments, by any mean. I really don't feel comfortable when I get them,probably in my previous existence I had a hypertrophic ego and karma decided toput me on diet in this life by giving me a mind that is allergic to appreciations-Many nations of East Asia and Southeastern Asia are blocked. I'm not interestedat all in daily floods of barely understandable annoying messages in brokenenglish by girls with a fetish for european guys.-Sarcasm masters and edgy users shouldn't contact me. I have to state it clearly,because many of them after reading my description decided to write me believingthat I was one of their specie: sorry, but there is a huge difference between ironyand hurting the others in a wannabe-smartass way just to demonstrate to theuniverse that we exist. I'm not interested in talking to individuals withoutpersonality and interests who make the others suffer just to have a distractionfrom their own sadness and life void. Nothingness dressed as people isn't worth mytime.~ If you want to catch my attention please put some efforts and try to do it in asmart way.

Or Mississippi Burning?Those are two very watchable films that demonstrate people overcoming their hatred towards the \"other\". Whitesupremacists hate blacks. You hate men and boys.Think of yourself like a white person living in Mississippi during the 50's. Society currently supports your hatred,but in your heart of hearts you probably know it's wrong, otherwise you wouldn't frequent this sub.You're obviously a feminist but don't even have the balls to call yourself one, which makes you doubly pathetic.Thave far more respect for someone like David Duke who openly expresses their hatred than some cowardwearing a Klan hoodIndeed for most of the points I argued there are even self-described feminists -- and not just righteousdissidents like Christina Hoff Sommers -- that understand the scientific research and agree that reforms arenecessary.‘You are far worse than a feminist. You simply refuse to acknowledge the available data. You're certainly worsethan a \"coffee shop feminist,\" a person who isn't aware of the relevant data and thinks of feminism as an\"equality\" movement. You're aware of the problems, you just don't careYou accuse me of becoming \"more of an asshole\" after saying my being mutilated as a baby “isn't about me.”That's just mind-boggling,Such a comment could only come from a deeply disturbed mind.You're intelligent. But Ted Bundy was intelligent. Intelligence doesn't equate to wisdom and certainly notcommon sense. As Chomsky has noted, common sense is particularly lacking among intellectuals.Thope you get help, and are able to reconcile your pathological hatred.‘The greatest irony of man-haters like you is that you don't even recognize you're harming yourself in theprocess. You're also harming children, but as you have made abundantly clear, you don't care about boys. It'stoo bad, because you can't harm one sex without harming the other.context full comments (77) report block user mark unread reply\n",

Here's how:Step 1: Fire up the of Bitcoin Core walletStep 2: Create your transaction, but hold off on hitting sendStep 3: Calculate the size of your transaction in number of bytes, bychecking the number of inputs and outputs in your transaction.Step 4: Next, simply log on to https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#24hto check the current levels of network congestion4a: If you want to be really decentralized, SSH into your raspberry pifull node and enter the command bitcoin-cli getrawnempool4b: count the number of lines(each line is one pendingtransaction).4c. The average transactionsize is 300 bytes, so multiplythe total number of lines by300, then divide by 1024, anddivide by 1024 again to getnumber of megabytes in themempool4d. Then, if the result of theprevious calculation is greater than 20, you should wait until theweekend before sending your transactionStep 5: Next, simply check https://bitcoinfees.21.co/ to find theaverage fees you need to pay to get your transaction included inthe next 12 hours. The interface is super intuitive, even yourmother could understand 5 siStep 6: Using the size of yourtransaction in bytes, calculatethe total number of satoshisyou will need to add as atransaction fee.Step 7: Finally! You're ready to. =Fhit send! iStep 8: If, after you send your transaction, there is a sudden influx ofnew transactions, you might have to wait a few days for your paymentto go through. But not to worry!Step 9: Manually craft a new transaction that uses the previousunconfirmed output as an input, and include a higher fee than you didlast time. Clearly you were just using Bitcoin wrong by not properlycalculating the correct feeStep 10: Success! Now just wait 6-24 hours for your payment toconfirm,And the best part is, it's slightlycheaper than sending a wire transfer!Checkmate, banks.\n",

      "915212299891363840 British Office CultureThis is by no means a definitive guide and it is important to keep in mind that the actual officeculture may be different with your placement. Remember, when in doubt about how somethingshould be done or what is appropriate in your particular office, ask for clarification.Humour: The accepted stereotype is that Brits have a dry sense of humour which is oftencharacterised by sarcasm and self-deprecation. British humour is not intended to be malicious orhurt other people's feelings, but it may take you some time to get used to this.The British Reserve: You may find your co-workers are far more reserved than what you are usedto, but this could just be shyness in a situation. It may take some time for you to get acquainted,but don't be afraid to introduce yourself to people. Brits can often seem very formal and ‘primand proper’, and while this can often be true, you will also find British people — Londoners inparticular — to be very liberal and laid back.Tea Culture: Tea drinking is a big part of office life and making tea is a task that is carried out byall members of staff. Do not be offended if you are asked to make tea for your colleagues as it isnot considered a demeaning task. If you are unsure about how to make tea, ask your colleagues.They will be pleased to show you and it will be a great way to break the ice.Pace of Work: You may find the pace of work in your office slower than you are used to. Britishworkers tend to take time out of their day to talk to each other, and building relationships inbusiness settings is an important cultural feature. However, this does not mean that less isachieved in a British office.Pub Culture: Going to the pub to relax and socialise is a big part of working and living inLondon. Visiting the pub after work or even during lunch hour is common. But there is also nopressure — it is perfectly acceptable to go to the pub and not drink alcohol.\n",

Accor-ding to two studies, we're morelikely to empathise with stru-ggling dogs than people in diffi-culty, Medical research charityHarrison’s Fund conducted anexperiment two years ago totest whether people were morelikely to donate money to helpdogs or humans, and they con-cluded it’s the former. The rese-archers printed two advertsboth of which posed the ques-tion: “Would you give £5 to saveHarrison from a slow, painfuldeath?” The only difference bet-ween the adverts was the pictu-re—onefeatured Harrison asalittleboy, theotherasadog. Andit was Harrison the dog who re-ceived themost donations.This idea is backed up byanother recent study. This ti-me, professors Jack Levin andArnold Arluke, from Northeas-tern University in Boston, gave240 participants one of four fa-kenewspaper reports. Thearti-cles described anattack “withabaseball bat by an nknownas-sailant.” It went on: “Arrivingonthesceneafewminutesafterthe attack, a police officer fo-und the victim with one brokenleg, multiple lacerations, andunconscious.” But in each ver-sion, the victim was different— it was either a one-year-oldinfant, a 30-year-old adult, apuppy or a six-year-old adultdog, The report, published inthejournal Society & Animals,reveals that participants wereasked to describe their emo-tions using standard ques-tions tomeasure empathy. Theparticipants who'd read a sto-ry abouta child, dog or puppymeasured similar levels ofempathy, butthe human adultprovoked less of aresponse.“Respondents were signifi-cantly less distressed whenadult humans were victimised,in comparison with human ba-ies, puppies and adult dogs.Only relative to the infant vie-tim did the adult dog receive lo-wer scores of empathy,” the re-searchers said.

I was shopping with my friends all day long, so I thought he wasupset at the fact that I was bit late, but he made no comment on it. Conversation‘wast't flowing, so I suggested that we go somewhere quiet so we could talk. He agreed,‘but he didn't say much. asked him what was wrong: He said, ‘Nothing.’ I asked himitwas my fault that he was upset. He said he wasn't upset, that ithhad nothing to dowithme, and not to worry about it. On the way home, I told hin that I loved him. He smiledslightly, and kept driving. I can’t explain his behavior I don't know why he didn't say,‘Tove you, too.’ When we got home, I felt as if Thad lost him completely, asif hewanted nothing to do with me anymore. He just sat there quietly, and watched TV. Hecontinued to seem distant and absent. Finally, with silence all around us, I decided togotobed. About 1g minutes later, he came to bed. But I still felt that he wasdistracted, and his thoughts were somewhere else. He fell asleep ~ I cried. I don’know what to do: I'm almost sure that his thoughts are with someone else. My life is adisaster.His Diary:‘Motoreycle won'tstart..can't figure out why.\n",
